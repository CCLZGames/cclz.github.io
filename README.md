I'm the CEO of a little company that I like to call, CCLZ.

It used to be called CCLZGames, but we are working on making music and short animations. All music and animations will be on scratch. I know It's an interesting choice, but I have nowwhere else to put music and animations onto, other than itch.io, but that's made for games not animations and music.
