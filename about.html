    <h2>Zachary</h2>
    <p>CEO</p>
    <p>Hello, i'm Zachary i'm the CEO of CCLZGames. when I wanted to make a company I wanted to make video games, so thats what i did.
        The day after I thought of having a website I went to school and asked one of my friends (Corey) if he wanted to work for
        me and he said yes, so I gave him the application and he officially signed it. So that was my first enployee (I don't do applications now).
